### Added

- `tack-expr`, a package of field expressions: VTK calculator syntax over
  `tack.dataset` fields, compiled to Tack kernels, with derivatives, units, a
  field dictionary, tensors and complex values. `tack_expr.field(text)` is a
  field argument for any algorithm, read on each dataset or piece; an
  expression names `normals`, `measures` and `centroids` where the dataset
  stores no field of the name.
